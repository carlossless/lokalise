# Lokalise - the unofficial node lokali.se client.

This is all still very WIP.

## How to use

In your working directory create a `.lokalise.json` file with the following contents:

```
{
  "api_token": "<YOUR LOKALI.SE API TOKEN>",
  "project_id": "<YOUR PROJECT ID>",
  "output_path": "<PATH WHERE LOCALIZATION FILES WILL BE PUT>"
}
```
